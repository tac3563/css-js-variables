What are we building?

- A slider which blurs the background image.

What are the key parts of the project?

- Having a background image
- Having a slider
- Updating the blur property on the background image based on the slider value.

How would you accomplish this?

- Set a blur on BG image which is assigned to a CSS variable.
- Create a slider (input type=range) with a default value.
- Add an event listener to the slider whenever the value changes
- Create a handler function for the event which updates the CSS variable's value to match the slider's value.
